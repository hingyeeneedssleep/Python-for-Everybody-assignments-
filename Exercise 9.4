'''
9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
    The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
    The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
    After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
